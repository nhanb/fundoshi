Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Which python version?
----------------------

Fundoshi supports Python 3.7 or later, my excuse being that even Debian Stable
comes with 3.7 now and if you're still trying to run outdated python then...
sucks to be you.

Why name it "Fundoshi"?
-----------------------

Because I can.
